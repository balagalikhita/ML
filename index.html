            <div id="subtitle">In the real world, we are surrounded by humans who can learn everything from their
                experiences with their learning capability, and we have computers or machines which work on our
                instructions. But can a machine also learn from experiences or past data like a human does? So here
                comes the role of Machine Learning.</div>

                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        </span>
                        A subset of artificial intelligence known as machine learning focuses primarily on the creation
                        of
                        algorithms that enable a computer to independently learn from data and previous
                        experiences.Without
                        being explicitly programmed, machine learning enables a machine to automatically learn from
                        data,
                        improve performance from experiences, and predict things.
                        A machine learning system builds prediction models, learns from previous data, and predicts the
                        output of new data whenever it receives it. The amount of data helps to build a better model
                        that
                        accurately predicts the output, which in turn affects the accuracy of the predicted output.

                    <h3>SUPERVISED LEARNING</h3>
                </span>
                In supervised learning, sample labeled data are provided to the machine learning system
                for training, and the system then predicts the output based on the training data.
                The system uses labeled data to build a model that understands the datasets and learns about each one.
                After the training and processing are done, we test the model with sample data to see if it can
                accurately predict the output.
                The mapping of the input data to the output data is the objective of supervised learning. The managed
                learning depends on oversight, and it is equivalent to when an understudy learns things in the
                management of the educator. Spam filtering is an example of supervised learning.

                Supervised learning can be grouped further in two categories of algorithms:

                    <h3>UNSUPERVISED LEARNING</h3>
                </span>
                Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which models are trained using unlabeled dataset
                and are allowed to act on that data without any supervision.Unsupervised learning cannot be directly
                applied to a regression or classification problem because unlike supervised learning, we have the input
                data but no corresponding output data. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find the underlying
                structure of dataset, group that data according to similarities, and represent that dataset in a
                compressed format.
